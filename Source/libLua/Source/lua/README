See INSTALL for installation instructions.

* What is Lua?
  ------------
  Lua is a powerful, light-weight programming language designed for extending
  applications. Lua is also frequently used as a general-purpose, stand-alone
  language. Lua is free software.

  For complete information, visit Lua's web site at http://www.lua.org/ .
  For an executive summary, see http://www.lua.org/about.html .

  Lua has been used in many different projects around the world.
  For a short list, see http://www.lua.org/uses.html .

* Availability
  ------------
  Lua is freely available for both academic and commercial purposes.
  See COPYRIGHT and http://www.lua.org/license.html for details.
  Lua can be downloaded at http://www.lua.org/download.html .

* Installation
  ------------
  In the LuaDist distribution the default makefiles have been replaced with
  CMake. To build Lua use the following approach.
  > mkdir _build && cd_build
  > ccmake .. # Set up configuration, alternatively use cmake-gui on Windows.
  > cmake --build . --target install
  
  The default makefile should work too, you just need to edit src/luaconf.h.orig
  and save it as src/luaconf.h.
  
  > make
  
  See INSTALL for detailed instructions with make.

* Origin
  ------
  Lua is developed at Lua.org, a laboratory of the Department of Computer
  Science of PUC-Rio (the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro
  in Brazil).
  For more information about the authors, see http://www.lua.org/authors.html .
