--- LuaDist Primary API functions
-- Peter DrahoÅ¡, Peter Kapec, LuaDist Project, 2010

--- This file contains the basic functions of LuaDist.
-- Feel free to use this exposed API in your projects if you need to deploy something automatically.
-- Please note that everything may change in future releases.
--- Terminology used:
-- _dist_ - General reference to "package" in LuaDist, often synonymous with _info_.
-- _info_ - Meta-data describing a _dist_. Collected from dist.info files inside dist archives.
-- _manifest_ - A collection of sorted _info_ entries in a table. Sorted alphabetically by name and by version descending.
-- _name_ - Refers to a string containing dist name and version constraints. Eg. "lua-5.1.4" or "luajit>=2"
-- _deployment_ - A directory containing dists installed using LuaDist.

module ("dist", package.seeall)

-- Include Submodules
local man = require "dist.manifest"
local pkg = require "dist.package"
local per = require "dist.persist"
local cfg = require "dist.config"
local sys = require "dist.sys"
local dep = require "dist.dep"
local log = require "dist.log"

--- Get contents of repository or a list of repositories.
-- _getManifest_ is used to fetch or generate collections of dist.info entries from
-- URIs, system paths and on-line repositories. Returned dist manifests are not 
-- filtered and may not be appropriate for installation, see _filterManifest_ for this 
-- purpose.
--
-- Dist information is gathered by collecting dist.info entries from dist.manifest 
-- file in case an URL to on-line repository is given. System paths are searched 
-- for dist.info files on demand and do extracted dists can be used for local 
-- repositories, this is handy for bootstrap and development of multiple 
-- interconnected dists. Zip archives and dists are peeked into on demand and in
-- case it contains dist.info entry its added to the manifest. 
--
-- In case of multiple repositories, first repository always has priority. Dists are
-- ordered by repository, name and version. Every item is checked, malformed entries 
-- are removed.
--
-- @param repositories string or table: Path or URL of a repository or repositories. By default cfg.repo is used if argument is not defined.
-- @return manifest: Table containing collections of available dists.
function getManifest(repositories)
    -- If no repository is provided use default ones from configuration.
    repositories = repositories or cfg.repo
    -- Make sure the argument is always a table.
    if type(repositories) == "string" then repositories = { repositories } end
    -- Check if we can continue.

--- Get all installed dists from deployment directory.
-- _getInstalled_ will collect all installed dists inside a deployment directory.
-- These represent installed dists; provided dists are not included, see _getDeployed_
-- if you need a provided dists too.

-- @param deployment string: Path to deployment directory. If not specified the deployment LuaDist is running in will be used.

--- Get all deployed dists in the target dir, this will also list dists provided by other dists.
-- _getDeployed_ will collect all deployed dists inside a deployment directory.
-- This inludes entries that simulate provided dists which act as dependency satisfaction for dists
-- during installation.
--
-- Integration with host package managers can be achieved by providing a list of modules already
-- installed directly to the host system. The list can be edited directly by the user in configuration.
--
-- @param deployment string: Path to deployment directory. If not specified the deployment LuaDist is running in will be used.

--- Filter dist manifests using constraint functions.
-- _filterManifest_ is used to remove dists from dist manifests that don't satisfy conditions.
-- Conditions are specified using a table of functions. Functions are named after the attribute
-- they check and return true if an argument satisfies its condition.
--
-- When constraint are not defined a default set of constraints is used. These constraints filter
-- out dists not suitable for the architecture LuaDist is running on. More specifically, only dists
-- of arch "Universal" or of arch equal to cfg.arch and of type "all" or type equal to cfg.type
-- are preserved. Additionally when source dists are enabled in configuration this will include dists
-- of type equal to "source".
--
-- In case no manifest is specified _filterManifest_ will automatically collect dist manifests from default
-- repositories using _getManifest_.
--
-- @param list table: Dist list or manifest to filter. By default all dists collected from cfg.repo will be filtered.
-- @param constraints table: Table of constraint function. Key determines what dist attribute is checked while the value is the actual constraint test written as a function. By default dists are filtered for correct arch-type.
-- @return manifest: Table containing collections of filtered dists.
function filterManifest(list, constraints)
	-- By default fetch dists if not provided
	list = list or getManifest() or {}

	return manifest

--- Find dists in manifest by name.
-- _findDists_ will find all dists in manifest that satisfy conditions in the name string.
-- Name contains dist name to search for and a set of optional version constraints. For example
-- searching for "lua-5.1.4" will find all dists of name "lua" and version "5.1.4". Searching for version
-- ranges is done using sets of constraints eg. "luajit >= 2.0 < 3.0". For more information, limitations
-- and use of the constraint system please see LuaDist documentation.

-- @param name string: String specifying the dist to find, version constraints can be used. Case sensitive.

--- Collect dependencies.
-- _getDeps_ is the magic function where dependency resolving happens.
-- This function handles multiple names for which it computes the best possible set of dists that satisfy
-- all the names. It consideres provided dists, conflicts and dependencies of each candidate dist and avoids
-- dependency loops. It may not be very elegant or efficient, contributions welcome.
--
-- The algorithm relies on sequential satisfaction of names. For each name it tries to determine
-- best possible candidate and tries to install its dependencies and rest of the names list. 
-- If dependencies fail another candidate is checked untill all names check out or candidates run out.
-- Provides are faked by injecting dists into manifest and replaced before return.
-- 
-- @param names string or table: Names to compute dependencies for.
-- @param manifest table: Manifest of dists to select dependencies from, needs to be sorted.
