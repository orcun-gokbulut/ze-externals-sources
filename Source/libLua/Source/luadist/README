* About LuaDist
  -------------
  LuaDist is a CMake-based multi-platform standalone Lua distribution
  providing a build environment and module management. For more information
  please visit http://www.luadist.org.

* Availability
  ------------
  LuaDist is freely available for both academic and commercial purposes under
  MIT license. See COPYRIGHT for details. Please see individual packages for
  their license.

* Installation
  ------------
  LuaDist relies on CMake (www.cmake.org) for building. The build process
  consists of two stages. First stage in the CMake based bootstrap that will
  build and install all needed components. Second stage uses the bootstrap 
  environment to build and install the final release. This process is needed to
  ensure LuaDist remains self update-able and endorses its correct deployment
  structure.

  To build LuaDist on Unix (including Linux, OS X and Cygwin) systems simply
  use the provided build bash script.

	> ./build [optional CMake arguments]
	
  LuaDist can be built natively on Windows using MinGW and MSVC compilers
  (possibly others). For this purpose we provide respective build.bat and
  build_msvc.bat scripts which you can use.

* Running
  -------
  LuaDist installs to a standalone directory and should be able to execute on
  most systems supported systems without the need to set up any environment.

  To invoke the luadist CLI simply use:
	$ cd luadist/bin
	$ ./lua luadist

  Any other binaries distributed using LuaDist can also be invoked directly
	$ cd luadist/bin
	$ ./luac
	
  If you experience problems with dynamic libraries or missing Lua modules you
  can ensure LuaDist finds them by providing following environment variables:
	$ export DIST_ROOT=/full/path/to/luadist
	$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$DIST_ROOT/lib
	$ cd $DIST_ROOT/bin
	$ ./lua luadist

* Compatibility
  -------------
  LuaDist was designed to support Unix/Linux, Mac and Windows
  installs.

  We are testing on the following operating systems:
	Ubuntu 10.10, amd64 and x86
	OS X 10.6, intel i386 and x86_64
	Windows 7 with MinGW compiler, 32bit
